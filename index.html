        <h3>What the heck is Electronics Night?</h3>
        <p>Electronics Night is a weekly meetup of makers, hackers, artists, and engineers interested in all things technology. The group meets at <a href="https://sparkmakerspace.org">Spark Makerspace</a> at 7 Union St in New London from 6-8pm.</p>
        <p>Bring something to show off or just stop by to see what others are working on.</p>
        <p>Areas of interest include electronics, circuit and PCB design, 3D printing, electronic art, game design, web design, systems administration, reverse-engineering, and more. Most folks bring a laptop, though that's certainly not a requirement.</p>
        <h4>Electronics aren't my thing, is this still the meetup for me?</h4>
        <p>We are welcoming to nerds of all kinds! Whether you're into electronics, 3D printing, programming, game design, lasers, robots, or something else, swing by and say 'greetings!'</p>
        <h4>Where can I park?</h4>
        <p>Street parking in New London is free (and unlimited after 6pm). If there isn't a spot on the street, there's a municipal lot at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8fNxNbcXM6tUGfL8A">1 Eugine O'Neill Drive</a> (about a block away) that's free after 6pm.</p>
        <h4>Other Questions?</h4>
        <p>Email electronics at sparkmakerspace.org or swing by. You can also check out <a href="https://sparkmakerspace.org">sparkmakerspace.org</a>.</p>
